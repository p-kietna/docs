Great question — let's break down how `setTimeout` works and what happens if `setProgress` doesn't "reach" it.

### ⏱ What Is `setTimeout`?

`setTimeout` is a JavaScript function that schedules a task to run **after a specified delay** (in milliseconds). It doesn’t block the code — it just sets a timer and moves on.

#### Example:
```ts
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This runs after 1 second");
}, 1000);
```

This schedules the `console.log` to run **after 1000 milliseconds (1 second)**.

### 🧠 What Happens in Your Case?

Let’s say you’re using this pattern:

```ts
const progressRef = useRef(0);
const throttleTimer = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);

const updateProgress = (count: number, partCount: number) => {
  progressRef.current = Math.round((count / partCount) * 100);

  if (!throttleTimer.current) {
    throttleTimer.current = setTimeout(() => {
      setProgress(progressRef.current); // runs after 1 second
      throttleTimer.current = null;
    }, 1000);
  }
};
```

### 🔍 What Happens Inside That 1 Second?

- You might call `updateProgress` many times (e.g. uploading multiple parts).
- Each time, `progressRef.current` is updated with the latest value.
- But `setProgress` is **not called immediately** — it waits for the timeout.
- When the timeout finishes, it uses the **latest value** from `progressRef.current`.

---

### ❓ What If `setProgress` Doesn’t “Reach” Timeout?

If you mean:

> “What if the upload finishes before the timeout fires?”

Then:

- The timeout is still active.
- `setProgress(progressRef.current)` will still run after 1 second — using the final value.
- You’ll get a **delayed but accurate update**.

If you want to **force an immediate update** when the upload finishes, you can manually clear the timeout and call `setProgress`:

```ts
if (uploadFinished && throttleTimer.current) {
  clearTimeout(throttleTimer.current);
  throttleTimer.current = null;
  setProgress(progressRef.current); // final update
}
```

### 🧩 Summary

| Scenario                          | Result                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `updateProgress` called repeatedly | Only one `setProgress` fires after 1 sec   |
| Upload finishes before timeout    | Timeout still fires with final value       |
| You want instant final update     | Manually clear timeout and call `setProgress` |
