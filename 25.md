Excellent question — you're referring to the use of **two layers of promises** in the `uploadPartsStreamed` function: one for the **individual uploads**, and one for the **overall control flow**. Let’s break down why both are necessary and what each one does.

### 🎯 The Two Promises Explained

#### 1. **Per-part upload promise (`uploadPart`)**
This is the `Promise<void>` returned by each individual upload task:

```ts
const promise = uploadPart(part); // returns a promise
```

- It represents the **status of a single part upload**.
- You need this to track when each upload finishes, succeeds, or fails.
- These promises are stored in a pool to manage concurrency.

#### 2. **Overall control promise (`uploadPartsStreamed`)**
This is the outer `Promise<void>` returned by the entire function:

```ts
await uploadPartsStreamed(...); // waits for all uploads to finish
```

- It ensures that **all uploads are completed** before moving on.
- Without this, your next action (e.g. finalizing the upload) could run too early.
- It wraps the logic that manages the pool and waits for all tasks.

### 🧠 Why You Need Both

| Purpose                     | Upload Promise (`uploadPart`) | Control Promise (`uploadPartsStreamed`) |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Tracks individual uploads  | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No                                     |
| Manages concurrency        | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                                    |
| Signals full completion    | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                                    |
| Enables retry logic        | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                                    |

If you only had one promise (e.g. just `Promise.all`), you'd lose control over concurrency and retry behavior. If you didn’t await the outer promise, your app would move on before uploads finish.

### 🔧 Analogy: Restaurant Orders

- Each `uploadPart` is like a waiter handling one table.
- The `uploadPartsStreamed` function is the manager making sure **all tables are served** before closing the kitchen.

Let me know if you want to simplify this into a reusable upload manager or add features like retry limits and progress bars. You're building something powerful here.
