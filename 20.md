Great question ‚Äî let‚Äôs break it down clearly:

---

### üîÅ Is This Recursive?

No, the pattern you're using is **not truly recursive** in the classical sense.

- **Recursion** means a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
- In your case, you're using a function (`next()`) that **calls itself inside a `.finally()` block**, which creates a **loop-like behavior** ‚Äî but it's not stack-based recursion.

So technically:  
‚úÖ **Not recursive** ‚Äî it's an asynchronous loop using closures and promises.

### ‚ö° Is This Good for Performance?

Yes ‚Äî **if used correctly**, this pattern is **great for performance** and scalability:

#### ‚úÖ Pros
- **Controlled concurrency**: You can set `maxConcurrent` to avoid overwhelming the network or server.
- **Streaming behavior**: As soon as one part finishes, the next starts ‚Äî no idle time.
- **Efficient memory usage**: No deep call stacks, no recursion overhead.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Watch Out For
- **Unbounded queue growth**: If you retry failed parts endlessly, the queue can grow forever. Add a retry limit.
- **Error handling**: Make sure failed requests are logged or retried intentionally.
- **Network saturation**: If `maxConcurrent` is too high, you might flood the network or hit rate limits.

### üß† Best Practices

- Use a retry counter or exponential backoff for failed parts.
- Tune `maxConcurrent` based on device/network conditions (e.g. 4‚Äì10 is usually safe).
- Track progress and completion for better UX.
