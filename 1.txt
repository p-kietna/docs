Great question — both strategies have their use cases, but here's a breakdown to help you choose the better one based on performance, reliability, and user experience.

### 📦 Case 1: Chunked Upload with Partial Success

**Strategy**: Upload 10 files at once. If some succeed, immediately append the next files to fill the chunk.

#### ✅ Pros:
- **Faster throughput**: You don’t wait for all 10 to succeed before moving on.
- **More resilient**: Failed files don’t block the rest — you retry only the failed ones.
- **Better for large batches**: Keeps the pipeline moving.

#### ❌ Cons:
- **More complex logic**: You need to track which files succeeded, retry failed ones, and manage dynamic chunking.
- **Harder to debug**: Partial failures can be tricky to trace.

### ⏳ Case 2: Wait for All 10 to Succeed Before Next Chunk

**Strategy**: Upload 10 files. Wait until all succeed. Then upload the next 10.

#### ✅ Pros:
- **Simpler logic**: Easier to manage success/failure per batch.
- **Predictable flow**: You know exactly when each chunk is done.
- **Better for transactional uploads**: If you need atomic success (e.g., all-or-nothing).

#### ❌ Cons:
- **Slower overall**: One failed file delays the entire batch.
- **Less efficient**: You’re not maximizing parallelism.

### 🧠 Which Is Better?

| Use Case                      | Recommended Strategy     |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Speed and scalability         | ✅ Case 1 (partial success) |
| Simplicity and reliability    | ✅ Case 2 (wait for all)   |
| Uploading critical documents  | ✅ Case 2                 |
| Uploading media or bulk files | ✅ Case 1                 |
