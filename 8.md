This error means you're passing a **single object** where TypeScript expects an **array of objects**.

### 🧠 What’s Going Wrong

You're likely doing something like:

```ts
const chunks: { partNumber: number; url: string };
```

But later using it like an array:

```ts
chunks.map(...) // ❌ TypeScript error
```

TypeScript complains:

> Type '{ partNumber: number; url: string; }' is missing array methods like `length`, `push`, `pop`, etc.

### ✅ How to Fix It

You need to define `chunks` as an **array of objects**, like this:

```ts
const chunks: { partNumber: number; url: string }[] = [
  { partNumber: 1, url: 'https://...' },
  { partNumber: 2, url: 'https://...' },
  // ...
];
```

Or if you're building it dynamically:

```ts
const chunks: Array<{ partNumber: number; url: string }> = [];
```

Then you can safely use:

```ts
chunks.map(...)
chunks.reduce(...)
```

Let me know if you want help generating chunk metadata for a file or building a full uploader with progress tracking and retries.
