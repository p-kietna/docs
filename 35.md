Not at all — defining internal functions like `uploadPart` and `runPool` inside `uploadPartsStreamed` **does not inherently cause poor performance**. In fact, it can be a clean and efficient way to encapsulate logic. But there are a few nuances worth understanding:

---

### ✅ Why Internal Functions Are Fine

- **Scoped tightly**: `uploadPart` and `runPool` are only used inside `uploadPartsStreamed`, so defining them there keeps your code modular and readable.
- **No redefinition overhead**: Since `uploadPartsStreamed` is only called once per upload session, the internal functions are created once per call — not repeatedly in a loop.
- **Avoids polluting global scope**: Keeps helper logic private and avoids unnecessary exports or top-level declarations.

### ⚠️ When Internal Functions Could Hurt Performance

Only in these edge cases:

1. **If `uploadPartsStreamed` is called very frequently** (e.g. hundreds of times per second), then yes — defining new functions each time could add overhead.
2. **If the internal functions close over large objects or state**, they could retain memory longer than needed.
3. **If you're using them inside tight loops**, and they’re redefined per iteration — that’s inefficient. But your code doesn’t do that.

### 🧠 Optimization Tip (if needed)

If you ever find yourself calling `uploadPartsStreamed` repeatedly in a high-frequency context, you could lift `uploadPart` and `runPool` outside:

```ts
const uploadPart = async (...) => { ... };
const runPool = async (...) => { ... };

async function uploadPartsStreamed(...) {
  await runPool(...);
}
```

But for your current use case — a single upload session — **your structure is perfectly fine**.
