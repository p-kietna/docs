Excellent follow-up ‚Äî comparing `percent` vs `progress` (the state variable) **can work**, but it‚Äôs not always the best choice depending on your performance goals. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### ‚úÖ Comparing `percent !== progress` ‚Äî What It Does

```tsx
if (percent !== progress) {
  setProgress(percent);
}
```

This checks whether the new calculated percentage is different from the current state, and only updates if needed. It‚Äôs a simple way to avoid redundant re-renders.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è But Why Use `useRef` Instead?

If you compare against `progress` (from `useState`), you're relying on a **value that only updates after a re-render**. That means:

- In fast loops (e.g. uploading hundreds of parts), `progress` might be **stale** for a few milliseconds.
- You might end up calling `setProgress(percent)` multiple times with the same value before React re-renders and updates `progress`.

#### Example Problem:
```tsx
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  const percent = Math.round((i / 100) * 100);
  if (percent !== progress) {
    setProgress(percent); // might still fire repeatedly
  }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Comparing Against `useRef` ‚Äî More Accurate

```tsx
const lastProgressRef = useRef(0);

if (percent !== lastProgressRef.current) {
  lastProgressRef.current = percent;
  setProgress(percent);
}
```

This avoids relying on React‚Äôs re-render cycle. You get:

- **Immediate access** to the last known value
- **No stale reads**
- **Precise control** over when `setProgress` is called

### üß† Summary

| Comparison Target     | Reliable? | Performance | Risk of Redundant Updates |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| `percent !== progress`| ‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes stale | ‚úÖ Decent | ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible in fast loops |
| `percent !== ref.current`| ‚úÖ Always fresh | ‚úÖ Best | ‚ùå Minimal |

So yes ‚Äî you *can* compare against `progress`, but using `useRef` gives you tighter control and better performance, especially in high-frequency update scenarios like file uploads.

Let me know if you want to add a smooth animation or estimated time remaining to your progress bar ‚Äî I‚Äôve got some slick ideas for that.
