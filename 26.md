Ah, now we're getting into the heart of concurrency control — and you're asking a sharp question. Here's the breakdown:

---

### 🎯 Why Use Both `Promise.race(pool)` and `Promise.all(pool)`

These two serve **different purposes** in a controlled concurrency system:

---

### 1. **`Promise.race(pool)` → Keeps the Pipeline Flowing**

- It waits for **any one** of the active uploads to finish.
- Once one finishes, you can **refill the pool** with another upload.
- This keeps the number of concurrent uploads at `maxConcurrent`.

#### 🔁 Think of it like:
> "As soon as one worker finishes, send in the next task."

Without `Promise.race`, you'd have to wait for **all uploads to finish** before starting more — which defeats the purpose of concurrency.

---

### 2. **`Promise.all(pool)` → Final Cleanup**

- After the queue is empty, you still have uploads **in progress**.
- `Promise.all(pool)` waits for **all remaining uploads** to finish.
- This ensures the function doesn't return until **everything is truly done**.

#### 🧹 Think of it like:
> "Before we close the shop, make sure all workers finish their last task."

### 🧠 Summary

| Purpose               | `Promise.race(pool)`         | `Promise.all(pool)`         |
|----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Keeps uploads flowing| ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No                        |
| Waits for all uploads| ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                       |
| Used during loop     | ✅ Inside `while`             | ❌ After loop                |
| Used for final await | ❌ Not needed at end          | ✅ Required at end           |

If you're building a high-performance uploader, this combo gives you **maximum throughput** without losing control. Want to add retry limits or progress tracking next? I can help you layer that in elegantly.
