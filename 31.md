You're absolutely right to question that — let’s clarify the difference and why `updateProgress` might still be useful even if it looks similar to using a regular `count` variable.

### 🧠 What `updateProgress` Is

In this context, `updateProgress` is likely a helper function that calculates the percentage and updates the UI:

```tsx
const updateProgress = (count: number, partCount: number) => {
  const percent = Math.round((count / partCount) * 100);
  setProgress(percent);
};
```

So when you call:

```tsx
countRef.current += 1;
updateProgress(countRef.current, partCount);
```

You're saying: “I just finished uploading one part — now update the progress bar.”

### 🔍 Why Not Just Use `const count`?

If you used a regular `let count = 0` inside your component:

- It would **reset on every render**, because React function components re-run.
- You’d lose track of progress unless you used `useState`, which causes re-renders.
- `useRef` avoids re-renders and keeps the value stable across async calls.

So this:

```tsx
const countRef = useRef(0);
```

Is better than:

```tsx
let count = 0; // ❌ resets on every render
```

And more efficient than:

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // ✅ but causes re-renders
```

### ✅ Why `updateProgress` Is Still Useful

Even though it looks simple, `updateProgress` gives you:

- A **central place** to calculate and update progress.
- A hook for adding throttling, animation, or logging later.
- Cleaner separation of logic: `onPartUploaded` handles counting, `updateProgress` handles UI.

---

### 🧩 TL;DR

- `countRef` is for internal tracking without re-renders.
- `updateProgress` is a helper to calculate and update the progress bar.
- It’s not redundant — it’s modular and future-proof.
