Ah, I see what you're aiming for â€” you want a system where **as soon as one chunk finishes uploading**, it **automatically triggers the next chunk**, creating a continuous flow without waiting for the entire batch to complete. This is a kind of **streamed or chained parallelism**, where chunks are processed in a pipeline-like fashion.

### âœ… Solution: Controlled Parallelism with Dynamic Queue

Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. Maintain a queue of chunks.
2. Limit concurrency (e.g., 1 or 2 chunks at a time).
3. As soon as one chunk finishes, dequeue the next and start it.
4. Retry failed chunks by re-adding them to the queue.

### ðŸ§© Code Sketch Using a Dynamic Worker Pool

```ts
async function uploadChunksContinuously(
  chunks: Array<{ partNumber: number; url: string }>,
  file: File,
  CHUNK_SIZE: number,
  signal: AbortSignal,
  maxConcurrency = 2
) {
  const queue = [...chunks];
  const failedChunks: typeof chunks = [];

  const uploadChunk = async ({ partNumber, url }: { partNumber: number; url: string }) => {
    const start = (partNumber - 1) * CHUNK_SIZE;
    const end = Math.min(start + CHUNK_SIZE, file.size);
    const part = file.slice(start, end);

    try {
      await axios.put(url, part, {
        signal,
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': file.type,
        },
      });
    } catch (err) {
      console.warn(`Chunk ${partNumber} failed`);
      failedChunks.push({ partNumber, url });
    }
  };

  const workers: Promise<void>[] = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < maxConcurrency; i++) {
    workers.push(
      (async function worker() {
        while (queue.length > 0) {
          const chunk = queue.shift();
          if (chunk) await uploadChunk(chunk);
        }
      })()
    );
  }

  await Promise.all(workers);

  if (failedChunks.length > 0) {
    console.warn(`Retrying ${failedChunks.length} failed chunks...`);
    // Optionally: call uploadChunksContinuously again with failedChunks
  }
}
```

### ðŸ§  What This Does

- Starts `maxConcurrency` workers that pull from the queue.
- As soon as one chunk finishes, the worker grabs the next.
- Failed chunks are collected and can be retried afterward.
- This creates a **continuous flow** of uploads without batching delays.

Let me know if you want to add retry limits, progress bars, or adaptive concurrency based on network speed â€” I can help you build a truly smart uploader.
