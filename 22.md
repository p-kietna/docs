In your current setup — where you're using `axios.put(...)` inside a `.finally()` block or a dynamic queue — **you absolutely should `await` the `axios.put` call** if you want to:

- **Track completion** of each upload
- **Handle errors properly**
- **Trigger the next upload only after the current one finishes**

---

### ✅ Why You Should `await axios.put`

```ts
await axios.put(url, part, {
  signal,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': file.type,
  },
});
```

This ensures:

- The upload completes before moving on.
- Any error is caught in your `try/catch` or `.catch()` block.
- You don’t overwhelm the network with uncontrolled concurrency.

---

### ⚠️ What Happens If You Don’t `await`

If you omit `await`:

```ts
axios.put(url, part, { ... }); // ❌ not awaited
```

Then:

- The upload starts, but your loop or worker **moves on immediately**.
- You lose control over sequencing and error handling.
- You might trigger too many uploads at once, causing **rate limits or memory issues**.

### 🧠 Summary

| Behavior                | With `await`         | Without `await`     |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Waits for upload       | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No               |
| Handles errors properly| ✅ Yes               | ❌ No               |
| Controls concurrency   | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No               |

So yes — you **should absolutely `await` `axios.put`** in your upload pipeline.
